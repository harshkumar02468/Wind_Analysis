Wind Energy Analysis Tool

üå¨Ô∏è Project Description:-
A high-performance Flask web application for analyzing wind energy potential using meteorological mast data. This tool processes wind speed measurements, applies power curves, calculates energy production, and generates detailed reports with statistical analysis.

üöÄ Key Features:-
Multi-threaded Processing: Utilizes ProcessPoolExecutor for parallel computation of wind data

Advanced Analytics:

Wind speed extrapolation to turbine hub heights

Energy production calculations with customizable loss factors

Weibull distribution fitting for wind resource assessment

Automated Reporting:

Excel data sheets with formatted tables and charts

Background generation for instant downloads

Optimized Performance:

Numba-accelerated numerical computations

Intelligent memory management with chunked processing

Comprehensive caching system

üìä Technical Highlights:

Backend: Python 3 with Flask framework

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Numba, SciPy

Parallel Computing: concurrent.futures, multiprocessing

Excel Generation: openpyxl with advanced styling

Caching: LRU caching, disk-based caching for large datasets

Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and error tracking

üìà Analysis Capabilities:
